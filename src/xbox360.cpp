* AnberPorts-Keyboard-Mouse
* 
* Part of the code is from from https://github.com/krishenriksen/AnberPorts/blob/master/AnberPorts-Keyboard-Mouse/main.c (mostly the fake keyboard)
* Fake Xbox code from: https://github.com/Emanem/js2xbox
* 
* Modified (badly) by: Shanti Gilbert for EmuELEC
* Modified further by: Nikolai Wuttke for EmuELEC (Added support for SDL and the SDLGameControllerdb.txt)
* Modified further by: Jacob Smith
* 
* Any help improving this code would be greatly appreciated! 
* 
* DONE: Xbox360 mode: Fix triggers so that they report from 0 to 255 like real Xbox triggers
*       Xbox360 mode: Figure out why the axis are not correctly labeled?  SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_RIGHTX / SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_RIGHTY / SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_TRIGGERLEFT / SDL_CONTROLLER_AXIS_TRIGGERRIGHT
*       Keyboard mode: Add a config file option to load mappings from.
*       add L2/R2 triggers
